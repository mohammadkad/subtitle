00:00:00,09 --> 00:00:04,07
Many organizations are shifting their project portfolios



2
00:00:04,07 --> 00:00:06,06
to Agile frameworks.



3
00:00:06,06 --> 00:00:10,02
However, even as the transition is taking place,



4
00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:12,07
traditional methods remain.



5
00:00:12,07 --> 00:00:16,00
In fact, in many cases both Agile



6
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:20,05
and traditional project methods continue to exist together.



7
00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:23,09
But knowing how to do that effectively can be a challenge.



8
00:00:23,09 --> 00:00:26,04
In fact, a lot of people think



9
00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:29,07
they can't even exist together at all.



10
00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:33,00
However, In this course we compare Agile



11
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:35,04
and traditional project frameworks:.
