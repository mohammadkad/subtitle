00:00:00,09 --> 00:00:04,07

- Many organizations are shifting their project portfolios



2

00:00:04,07 --> 00:00:06,06

to Agile frameworks.



3

00:00:06,06 --> 00:00:10,02

However, even as the transition is taking place,



4

00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:12,07

traditional methods remain.



5

00:00:12,07 --> 00:00:16,00

In fact, in many cases both Agile



6

00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:20,05

and traditional project methods continue to exist together.



7

00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:23,09

But knowing how to do that effectively can be a challenge.



8

00:00:23,09 --> 00:00:26,04

In fact, a lot of people think



9

00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:29,07

they can't even exist together at all.



10

00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:33,00

However, in this course we compare Agile



11

00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:35,04

and traditional project frameworks.
